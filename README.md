# Memory Game

## Project Overview
This project is a classic memory matching game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of the game is to match all pairs of cards with the least number of wrong tries. Each card hides a technology logo, and players must rely on memory and concentration to find matching pairs.

## How the Game Works
- The game starts when the user clicks the "Start Game" button.
- All cards are shuffled randomly on each game load.
- Clicking a card flips it to reveal the hidden image.
- When two cards are flipped:
  - If they match, they remain visible.
  - If they do not match, they flip back after a short delay.
- The game tracks the number of wrong tries made by the player.

## Features
- Random card shuffling on every reload
- Smooth flip animation using CSS 3D transforms
- Wrong tries counter
- Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Click disabling while comparing two cards to prevent bugs

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structure
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- JavaScript for game logic

## Responsive Design
The game layout adapts to different screen sizes using CSS media queries, ensuring a good experience on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops.
